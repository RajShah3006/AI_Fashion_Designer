Features
Email and Password Login: Users can log in using their registered email address and password.

Google Sign-In: Seamless authentication using Google accounts.

Loading Indicator: A visual loading overlay is displayed during authentication processes.

Error Handling: User-friendly error messages for various authentication failures.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Flutter SDK: Install Flutter

Firebase CLI: Install Firebase CLI

IDE: Visual Studio Code with Flutter and Dart extensions, or Android Studio.

Node.js & npm/yarn: Required for Firebase CLI.

Firebase Project Setup
This application relies heavily on Firebase for authentication. Follow these steps to set up your Firebase project:

Create a Firebase Project:

Go to the Firebase Console.

Click "Add project" and follow the on-screen instructions.

Enable Authentication Methods:

In your Firebase project, navigate to "Authentication" in the left sidebar.

Go to the "Sign-in method" tab.

Enable Email/Password provider.

Enable Google provider. Follow the instructions to configure it (you might need to select a support email).

Register Your Flutter Apps in Firebase:

For Android:

Click the Android icon on your Firebase project overview.

Follow the steps to register your Android app. You'll need your Package name (found in android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml, usually com.example.flutter_application_1).

Crucially, add your SHA-1 and SHA-256 fingerprints. You can get these by running keytool commands.

For debug SHA-1: keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android

For release SHA-1/SHA-256: Refer to the Firebase documentation for generating keys.

Download the google-services.json file and place it in your android/app/ directory.

For iOS:

Click the iOS icon on your Firebase project overview.

Follow the steps to register your iOS app. You'll need your Bundle ID (found in ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj or in Xcode under General settings for your Runner target).

Download the GoogleService-Info.plist file and place it in your ios/Runner/ directory. In Xcode, right-click Runner in the project navigator, select "Add Files to 'Runner'...", and add the GoogleService-Info.plist.

Important for Google Sign-In on iOS: You need to add a CFBundleURLTypes entry to your ios/Runner/Info.plist. The REVERSED_CLIENT_ID is found in your GoogleService-Info.plist.

<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
        <string>Editor</string>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <!-- TODO Replace this value: Copied from GoogleService-Info.plist key REVERSED_CLIENT_ID -->
            <string>com.googleusercontent.apps.YOUR_REVERSED_CLIENT_ID</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</array>

For Web:

Click the Web icon on your Firebase project overview.

Register your web app.

Copy the Firebase configuration snippet. You'll typically use flutterfire configure to handle this automatically.

Run flutterfire configure:

Open your terminal in the root of your Flutter project.

Run: dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli (if not already activated).

Then run: flutterfire configure

Follow the prompts to connect your Flutter project to your Firebase project and generate the lib/firebase_options.dart file.

Local Setup
Clone the repository (or start with your existing project files):

git clone <repository_url>
cd flutter_application_1

(Replace <repository_url> with your actual repository URL if applicable, otherwise navigate to your project directory.)

Install Dependencies:

Open your pubspec.yaml file.

Ensure the assets section is uncommented and includes your google_logo.png:

flutter:
  uses-material-design: true
  assets:
    - assets/google_logo.png # Make sure this line is uncommented and correctly indented

Run the following commands in your project root to clean and fetch dependencies:

flutter clean
flutter pub get

Place google_logo.png:

Make sure you have an image file named google_logo.png inside a folder named assets at the root of your project (e.g., your_project_name/assets/google_logo.png).

Running the Application
Ensure Firebase is initialized:

In your main.dart file, make sure Firebase is initialized before running your app:

import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';
import 'firebase_options.dart'; // This file is generated by flutterfire configure

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Firebase.initializeApp(
    options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,
  );
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

Run the App:

Connect a device or start an emulator.

Run the application from your IDE or terminal:

flutter run

For web: flutter run -d chrome

Project Structure
lib/login_page.dart: Contains the LoginPage widget with email/password and Google Sign-In logic.

assets/google_logo.png: The image asset used for the Google Sign-In button.

pubspec.yaml: Defines project dependencies and assets.

lib/main.dart: (Assumed) The entry point of your Flutter application, where Firebase is initialized.

lib/firebase_options.dart: (Generated by flutterfire configure) Contains platform-specific Firebase configuration.

Future Enhancements
The current login page has placeholders for:

Forgot Password: Implementing navigation to a password reset flow.

Sign Up Navigation: Navigating to a user registration page.
